This is the source code for my entry into the GMTK game jam 2020. A game with simple minigames where your keys are randomised regularly was an idea I had thought about for a while and the "Out of Control" prompt was a great opportunity to try it out.
After creatignt the first build I started adding in multiplayer but never got around to fully fleshing it out.
